## Installation & Setup

### 1. Using the oLama Framework

The oLama framework simplifies running Deep Seek R1 locally. It allows you to download and execute the model with a few simple commands.

1. **Download and Install oLama:**  
   Visit [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) to install the version for your operating system.

2. **Verify Installation:**  
   ```bash
   ollama --version
   ```
   
## Pull the Deep Seek R1 Model

For a lightweight start, run the 1.5B parameter version:




```bash
ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b
```
## 2. Interaction Methods

You can interact with Deep Seek R1 in several ways:

### Terminal
Directly type prompts in your command line.

### Open Web UI
Install via pip and run:
```bash
pip install open-webui
open-webui serve

```

## Usage Examples

### Command-Line Interaction

Type a prompt directly in your terminal:
```bash
ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b "Explain the significance of retrieval-augmented generation."
```

## Using Open Web UI

After installing and serving Open Web UI, access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. Here you can chat with Deep Seek R1 through a friendly interface.

## Integrating with Chainlit or Streamlit

Leverage Python frameworks to create custom UIs. For example, a simple Streamlit app:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Deep Seek R1 Chat")
user_input = st.text_input("Enter your question:")

if user_input:
    # Assume `query_deepseek` is a function that sends the prompt via oLama.
    response = query_deepseek(user_input)
    st.write(response)
```
